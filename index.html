	  <h1>The 2023 Drought</h1>
      <hr class="small"><p>The most recent drought, in 2023, afflicted more than half a million people in the Brazilian Amazon basin, making it one of the most severe droughts ever recorded. The drought was accompanied by enormous fish kills and the deaths of hundreds of river dolphins, all caused by extremely high air and water temperatures and low water levels in large areas. Tens of thousands of remote rural settlers along rivers were completely cut off from urban hubs and adjacent towns for weeks or months.</p>

          <hr class="small"><p>The severe drought of 2023 was not an isolated event. Studies have shown that the Amazon is undergoing an intensification of extreme events, both droughts and floods.<br><br>In our study, we found that the severe droughts of 2005, 2010, and 2015-2016, were not only abnormally intense, but also lasted longer than usual. We counted the number of days per hydrological year in which water levels during dry periods were lower than a historic threshold using data from 90 river gauging stations.</p>

	  <h1>Impacts on Navigation</h1>
      <hr class="small"><p>During severe droughts, low water levels constrain river navigation due to the lack of adequate water depth. As large sandbanks and boulders become exposed, river channels narrow down, restricting accessibility. As a result, boats and ships may dock far from ports, making it difficult for passengers to get to shore or requiring them to walk across the massive sandbanks. To prevent accidents, navigation speed is substantially decreased, and zig-zag routes are done to avoid obstacles. The Brazilian Navy issues warnings and may also impose restrictions on nighttime navigation, maximum speed, and vessel draft.</p>

        <div class="board">
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Navigation through rivers and wetlands is the most important form of transportation for most of the Amazonian population. It is particularly important, however, for rural communities, which rely on boats as a means to undertake regular daily activities such as reaching urban centres, schools, and healthcare facilities, trading their forest and agricultural products, reaching fishing and hunting sites, and visiting family members and friends in other towns.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">Travelling by boat is an essential part of the Amazonian culture and way of life, even for urban residents. Besides, navigation is fundamental for the supply of food, medicine, fuel, and other goods to rural villages. It is also the means through doctors, nurses, and government officials can reach these communities. When a severe drought strikes, access to services and goods become highly affected.</p>

    <h1>Isolation during Droughts</h1>
    <hr class="small"><p>We analysed the shortest distance between human settlements and major water bodies (rivers and wetlands) as well as roads in order to identify those locations that would, in theory, rely more on navigation than on terrestrial transportation. This indicator, although simple, allowed us to spot the non-Indigenous localities and Indigenous villages that are prone to some degree of isolation during severe droughts. This result might help decision-makers prioritise specific regions of the Amazon.</p>      
    <section id="question">
      <h2>Isolation during Droughts</h2>
      <hr class="small"><h1>Nearly half of non-Indigenous localities and 54% of Indigenous villages of the Brazilian part of the Amazon are prone to isolation during severe droughts.</h1>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">In our study, we found that nearly half of non-Indigenous localities as well as 54% of Indigenous villages could face some degree of isolation during severe droughts. The Amazonas State (AM) stands out with nearly 78% of its localities prone to isolation (n = 1,495) as well as 77% of its Indigenous villages (n = 755). Around 41% of the Indigenous villages in Roraima State (RR) (n = 225) could also face isolation.</p>
