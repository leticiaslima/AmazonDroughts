          <hr class="small"><p>The severe drought of 2023 was not an isolated event. Studies have shown that the basin is undergoing an intensification of extreme events, both droughts and floods. In our study, we found that the severe droughts of 2005, 2010, and 2015-2016, were not only abnormally intense, but also lasted longer than usual. We counted the number of days in which water levels were lower than a especific historic threshold for each one of the 90 river gauging stations under analysis.</p>
